## Section 1 – Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

### 1.1 – Social Engineering

### Phishing 

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals use various tactics, such as email, phone calls, or fake websites, to trick individuals into providing sensitive information. Here are some important points to consider:

1.  Types of Phishing: There are several types of phishing attacks, including spear phishing, clone phishing, whaling, and smishing. Spear phishing targets specific individuals, while clone phishing involves creating a fake website that looks identical to a legitimate one. Whaling targets high-level executives, while smishing uses SMS text messages to deceive individuals.
    
2.  Methods of Attack: Cybercriminals use various methods to carry out phishing attacks, such as email spoofing, which involves creating a fake email address that appears legitimate. They may also use link manipulation, which redirects individuals to a fake website or download malware onto their device.
    
3.  Warning Signs: Individuals should be aware of warning signs, such as suspicious email addresses, unexpected attachments, or requests for personal information. Fake websites may also have irregular URLs or spelling errors.
    
4.  Impact of Phishing: Phishing attacks can result in a range of negative consequences, such as financial loss, identity theft, or reputational damage. It can also lead to the compromise of sensitive business or personal data.
    
5.  Prevention: Individuals can prevent phishing attacks by being vigilant, verifying the sender's identity, and avoiding clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious sources. Employers can also provide employee training and implement security measures such as multi-factor authentication and spam filters.
    

Overall, phishing attacks are a significant threat to individuals and businesses alike. By understanding the methods used by cybercriminals and implementing preventative measures, individuals and organizations can better protect themselves from these types of attacks.

### Impersonation    

Impersonation is a type of cyberattack where an individual or entity pretends to be someone else in order to deceive others. Impersonation can take several forms, including:

1.  Email Impersonation: An attacker can impersonate someone by sending an email that appears to be from that person, typically with a fake email address or a slightly altered name.
    
2.  Social Media Impersonation: An attacker can create fake social media accounts that look like someone else's account, with the aim of deceiving the target's friends, family or followers.
    
3.  Caller ID Spoofing: Attackers can spoof the caller ID information to make it appear as if a call is coming from a legitimate source.
    
4.  Website Spoofing: Attackers can create fake websites that look like legitimate ones to trick people into sharing sensitive information.
    

The goal of impersonation is typically to obtain sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information or personal data. Impersonation can also be used for other malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or launching a social engineering attack.

To prevent impersonation attacks, it is important to be vigilant and verify the identity of the sender or caller. This can be done by using two-factor authentication, checking the sender's email address or phone number, and being cautious when opening links or attachments from unknown sources. Additionally, organizations can implement security measures, such as email filters and training programs, to help prevent impersonation attacks.

### Dumpster Diving    

Dumpster diving is a type of physical security attack where an attacker searches through a targeted organization's trash or recycling bins in order to find valuable information. The attacker may use information obtained through dumpster diving to launch a spear phishing attack, impersonating a trusted source to gain access to sensitive information or financial resources. In many places, dumpster diving is generally legal unless there are local laws or regulations that prohibit it. To prevent dumpster diving attacks, it is important to properly dispose of sensitive information and implement policies and procedures for handling sensitive information.

### Shoulder Surfing    

Shoulder surfing is when someone gathers personal and sensitive information by looking over your shoulder while you work on your computer. This is a common way for attackers to obtain password information and details about documents that you might be viewing on your computer. It can be done from close range, such as in an airport or on a plane, or even from a distance using binoculars or a telescope. It's important to be aware of your surroundings and to use tools like privacy filters to protect your screen and prevent shoulder surfing. In an office, it's also helpful to position your monitor away from windows or hallways to avoid exposure.

### Hoaxes    

The hoaxes often aim to get money by making people purchase gift cards and send the codes to the hoaxers. Some hoaxes may even make people believe they have a virus or malware on their system. The author provides examples of recent hoaxes they encountered, including a spam email claiming the recipient won $850,000 and a fake Adobe Flash Player update page that could install malware. To avoid falling victim to hoaxes, it's important to be suspicious of unsolicited messages, double-check information, use spam filters, and cross-reference with websites such as hoaxslayer.net and snopes.com.

### Watering Hole Attacks    

A watering hole attack is a tactic used by attackers to compromise a target organization's network by infecting a third-party website that is frequently visited by the organization's users. The attackers focus on finding vulnerabilities in the third-party website and attempt to infect as many visitors as possible. The attack is difficult to defend against, but a layered defense strategy with a next-generation firewall or intrusion prevention system can help mitigate the risk. One example of a watering hole attack occurred in 2017 on multiple financial sites. Users who had Symantec antivirus software installed were able to detect and block the attack. It's important to be aware of these types of attacks and take measures to prevent them.

### Spam    

The term "spam" refers to unsolicited messages that are sent through various communication channels, such as email, online forums, instant messaging, and text messaging. Spam messages can be commercial, non-commercial, or malicious, and they pose various problems for system administrators, including security concerns, resource utilization, and costs associated with storing and managing spam messages.

There are several strategies for preventing spam from reaching users' inboxes, including having a spam filter that can filter messages based on various characteristics, such as an allowed list of trusted senders, compliance with email transfer standards, and reverse DNS lookup. Other techniques include tar pitting, which slows down the conversation between servers and frustrates spammers, and recipient filtering, which rejects messages that are not addressed to a valid email address.

### Influence Campaigns    

The rise of social media has allowed for individuals or nation-states to manipulate public opinion. Bad actors may create fake accounts to spread their message across multiple social media platforms, with the intention of amplifying their message and changing the way people think in a particular area. The success of such influence campaigns can lead to military advantages, such as influencing elections or changing the type of news received by a particular country. This is known as cyber warfare, and while it is not fought on a traditional battlefield, it can still have significant impacts on global relations.

### Other Social Engineering Attacks    

Social engineering attacks such as tailgating, invoice scams, and credential harvesting are all serious threats to organizations and individuals. Tailgating occurs when an unauthorized person follows someone with valid credentials into a restricted area, while an invoice scam involves sending a fake invoice to an organization in order to obtain payment or sensitive information. Credential harvesting is the process of stealing usernames and passwords from an individual's computer, often through the use of malicious scripts.

Organizations can take steps to prevent these types of attacks, such as implementing access control vestibules, reminding employees not to tailgate, and training staff to recognize and report suspicious emails and requests. Individuals can also protect themselves by being vigilant about who they allow access to restricted areas, verifying the authenticity of invoices and requests, and using antivirus and anti-malware software to protect their computers from malicious scripts. By taking proactive measures to prevent social engineering attacks, organizations and individuals can better protect themselves against these threats.

### Principles of Social Engineering    

Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. Attackers use various tactics, such as authority, intimidation, social proof, scarcity, familiarity, and trust, to gain access to sensitive information or control of accounts. These attacks may involve multiple people or organizations, and can be automated using open source intelligence. A real-life example is the case of Naoki Hiroshima, whose Twitter username was stolen using social engineering techniques. It is important to be aware of these tactics and take steps to protect against social engineering attacks.

### 1.2 – Attack Types

### An Overview of Malware    

Malware is malicious software that can collect information from your computer, control it remotely, show unwanted advertisements, and even encrypt your private files for ransom. There are various types of malware, including viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, key loggers, adware, spyware, and botnets. Malware can spread through vulnerabilities in your operating system or applications, or through deceptive email links and website pop-ups. To prevent malware from infecting your computer, it's important to maintain the latest security updates and never click suspicious links or download unknown software.

### Viruses and Worms    

A virus is a type of malware that requires human intervention to start the replication process. There are different types of viruses, such as program viruses, boot sector viruses, script viruses, macro viruses, and fileless viruses. A worm, on the other hand, is a type of virus that can propagate itself from system to system without human intervention by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications. The WannaCry worm, which caused widespread damage in 2017, used the EternalBlue exploit to find vulnerable systems and then installed a backdoor application to download ransomware and encrypt files on the affected computer. It's important to keep antivirus software updated to protect against viruses and worms.

### Ransomware and Crypto-malware    

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts personal information on a computer or network and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. This can include personal files, company documents, financial information, and more. Attackers use this method to make money by exploiting the value of the data to the owner. Simple ways to protect against ransomware include maintaining security patches, running up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software, and having a backup that is not immediately accessible from the computer. This way, even if ransomware infects the system, the owner can recover the data without paying the attacker.

### Trojans and RATs    

A Trojan horse is a type of malware that pretends to be harmless software, but actually allows attackers to gain access to your computer and potentially install other malware. They can create backdoors into your system, making it easier for other malware to infect your computer. They may also install potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) which can cause performance issues. Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a type of backdoor malware that allow attackers to remotely access and control your computer. To prevent Trojan horse and RAT infections, you should avoid clicking unknown links, keep your antivirus software up to date, and regularly backup your system.

### Rootkits    

Rootkits are a type of malware that modify files in the kernel of an operating system, making them difficult to detect and remove. They are commonly used in combination with other malware to create a botnet that is challenging to remove. However, anti-malware and antivirus software can identify and remove some rootkits. The UEFI BIOS secure boot feature helps prevent rootkits from being installed on modern systems by checking for changes to the kernel during bootup.

### Spyware    

Adware and spyware are types of malicious software that can cause performance problems, track your browsing habits, and potentially steal personal information. They can be installed accidentally and are often difficult to remove. Prevention measures include using good antivirus and anti-malware software, being cautious when installing software from third-party websites, and having a known good backup. Software such as Malwarebytes anti-malware can also be helpful in removing this type of malware.

### Bots and Botnets    

A bot is a type of malware that can take control of your computer and be used in a botnet to perform nefarious activities. The botnet is controlled by a Command and Control server, and can be used for DDoS attacks, spamming, and other tasks. To prevent a botnet infection, ensure your system is up to date with the latest security patches and use antivirus and anti-malware software. Active infections can be identified through on-demand scans and unusual network traffic patterns, and can be blocked with firewalls or IPS.

### Logic Bombs    

A logic bomb is a type of attack triggered by a separate event, often left by disgruntled employees or those with a grudge against an organization. It can be difficult to identify and may delete itself once executed. Examples of time-based logic bombs include one that deleted master boot records and rebooted systems in South Korea in 2013, and one that disabled electrical circuits and connections throughout Ukraine in 2016. To prevent logic bombs, formal processes and controls should be in place for any changes made in the environment, and automated processes such as host-based intrusion prevention or Tripwire can be used to look for certain changes. Auditing processes should also be in place to ensure all changes made are authorized.

### Password Attacks  

Passwords stored in plain text are easily accessible to attackers. Therefore, it is best to store passwords using a hash function, which produces a unique string of text from the password input. The resulting hash is unique to the password and cannot be reversed to reveal the original password. Password files in applications and operating systems typically store the usernames and the hash of each password. Attackers may use spraying attacks, which try a few common passwords to gain access to an account without triggering account lockouts, or brute force attacks, which try every combination of letters, numbers, and special characters until a matching password is found. Brute force attacks can take a long time and require performing the hash on each password to compare it to the original hash.

### Physical Attacks    

Various types of physical attacks, including the use of malicious USB cables and flash drives that can infect a system with malware. It also highlights the dangers of skimming, where attackers steal credit card information by adding hardware to card readers and using cameras to capture PIN numbers. The article emphasizes the importance of being cautious about connecting USB devices and carefully examining card readers to prevent skimming. It also mentions the practice of cloning credit cards and gift cards for fraudulent use.

### Adversarial Artificial Intelligence    

Machine learning has revolutionized the way we use computers by allowing them to sift through vast amounts of data and find patterns that can be used to provide us with services or information. However, a major challenge with machine learning is that it requires a lot of data to train the systems properly. If the training data is poisoned with malicious or invalid information, it can render the resulting artificial intelligence invalid as well.

Attackers can also change their approach after the learning process is complete, making it important to periodically retrain machine learning systems with new, legitimate data. It's also crucial to use techniques to prevent vulnerabilities in machine learning processes and ensure that the data going into the systems is legitimate. Examples of poisoned training data include the Microsoft AI chatter bot Tay, which became a racist, sexist, and inappropriate bot due to lack of anti-offensive behavior or algorithms during its learning process.

### Supply Chain Attacks    

The supply chain is the chain of manufacturing that gets a product from the beginning to the end of its process. There is a lot of opportunity for attackers to infect the supply chain and affect downstream users. The Target Corporation breach in 2013 is a notable example of a supply chain attack where the attackers were able to take advantage of an HVAC supplier to gain access to the Target network and steal 40 million credit card numbers. Supply chain cybersecurity has become a significant concern for organizations, and many are narrowing down the number of vendors they work with and requiring strict controls and auditing to ensure trust in the products delivered. Organizations can also work with their suppliers to ensure a safer product all the way through the supply chain.

### Cloud-based vs. On-Premises Attacks    

Both on-premises and cloud-based data storage have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to data security. On-premises data storage gives you complete control and allows you to customize your security controls, but it can be costly and may take time to implement security changes. Cloud-based storage is centralized and cost-effective, with large-scale security provided by the provider, but there is a reliance on third-party services and users need to follow best practices for security. Ultimately, the choice between on-premises and cloud-based storage will depend on the specific needs and resources of the organization.

### Cryptographic Attacks    

A man-in-the-middle attack is another type of attack that can compromise the security of cryptographic communication. In this attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between two parties and alters the information being exchanged. The attacker can also eavesdrop on the conversation and steal sensitive information.

To prevent this type of attack, it’s important to use strong encryption protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) and to ensure that both parties are using the latest version of the protocol. It’s also important to verify the identity of the other party, for example, by using digital certificates.

Overall, it’s important to remain vigilant and keep up-to-date with the latest security vulnerabilities and patches to ensure that our cryptographic communications remain secure.

### 1.3 – Application Attacks

### Privilege Escalation    

Privilege escalation is a serious threat that can allow attackers to gain elevated access to a system or resources that they would not normally have access to. It is important to patch vulnerabilities quickly and use safeguards like data execution prevention to prevent these types of attacks. Keeping up to date with security patches and using antivirus and anti-malware software can also help protect against privilege escalation attacks. It is also important to be aware of vulnerabilities like the Windows Remote Access Elevation of Privileged Vulnerability and take appropriate action to protect against them.

### Cross-site Scripting    

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability found on web-based applications that allows attackers to gather information from a victim's machine without their knowledge. There are two types of XSS attacks: non-persistent or reflected, and persistent or stored. Reflected attacks require the victim to click a specific link containing malicious scripts that are then sent to the attacker. Stored attacks can be permanently embedded on a server and run whenever anyone visits the page, potentially spreading very quickly over social media. A practical example of XSS was found in the Subaru website when a security researcher discovered that an authentication token allowing access to service requests never expired and could be used by anyone to gain access to the victim's account details. Additionally, the website had a cross-site scripting vulnerability that further compounded the problem. It is essential to prevent these types of scripting vulnerabilities in web-based applications to protect user information.

### Injection Attacks    

Code injection attacks can be very dangerous and can allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or even take control of a system. It’s important for developers to validate and sanitize all input to prevent these types of attacks. As a user, it’s important to be aware of the risks and only trust applications and websites that have a good reputation for security. Always be cautious about entering personal information into a form or application that you’re not familiar with. By taking these precautions, we can help prevent code injection attacks and keep our information secure.

### Buffer Overflows    

A buffer overflow attack occurs when one section of memory is able to overwrite a different section of memory, which can give an attacker control over the system or cause an application to behave in a certain way. It is a result of poor programming, and developers should perform bounds checking to prevent it. It is difficult to find and replicate, but can be very dangerous if successful. A visual example is given to explain how it works.

### Replay Attacks    

A hacker can gather network information by installing a network tap or using logical ways like ARP poisoning. They can replay attacks by capturing information and pretending to be the original user. Pass the hash is a simple replay attack that involves stealing the hash value associated with a password that is sent across the network during authentication. Developers can avoid this attack by ensuring that the client and the server communicate over an encrypted channel and by salting the hash. It is important to secure browser cookies as they may contain personalization details or session management information, which can be used by hackers for replay attacks. The session hijack or sidejack attack requires the attacker to first gain access to the session ID. To prevent this attack, it is important to use an encrypted protocol such as SSL or TLS when communicating across the network. The attacker can also modify their browser cookies to make them look identical to those that would come from the victim’s computer.

### Request Forgeries    

CSRF attacks take advantage of the trust a website has in a user’s browser to send requests to a server using the user’s credentials. The video explains how this can be done using a hyperlink in an email, for example, and how it can be prevented using anti-forgery techniques, such as a cryptographic token. The video also explains server-side request forgery (SSRF), where an attacker sends specially crafted packets to a web server to perform requests on their behalf. The video emphasizes the importance of closing vulnerabilities before someone is able to take advantage of them.

### Driver Manipulation    

Attackers are constantly looking for new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems. They may use zero day attacks or target trusted drivers to gain access to sensitive information. Shims in the operating system, such as the Windows compatibility mode, can also be exploited by malware authors to bypass security features. Refactoring or metamorphic malware is another tactic that makes it difficult for antivirus software to detect and stop the malware. As a result, layered approaches to security are necessary to protect against these constantly evolving threats.

### SSL Stripping    

SSL stripping is a type of attack where an attacker sits in the middle of the communication between a client and a server and modifies the data flow, so that it can see all the data in the flow. The attacker can do this by using proxy server configuration, ARP spoofing, or a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot. The attack can be avoided by upgrading and maintaining software on both the client and server workstation. The evolution of SSL/TLS has seen various versions being deprecated due to vulnerabilities, with TLS 1.2 and 1.3 being the latest standards. During an SSL stripping attack, the attacker intercepts the request for an encrypted page and sends it in the clear to the website visitor, while setting up an encrypted channel between themselves and the web server. The attacker can view all the information passing through the communication, including usernames and passwords. To avoid this type of attack, web browsers and servers should be configured to only use HTTPS.

### Race Conditions    

A race condition occurs when multiple things happen simultaneously and developers haven't planned for it. Attackers can exploit this with time-of-check to time-of-use attacks. A simple example of a race condition is transferring money between two accounts, where multiple users perform the transfer at the same time, leading to incorrect balances. Race conditions can have disastrous consequences, such as in the Mars rover Spirit reboot loop, the Northeast Blackout of 2003, and the radiation therapy machine incidents in the 1980s. It's important for developers to consider every possible scenario and plan for it in their software.

### Other Application Attacks    

Memory vulnerabilities can give attackers control over a device or system. A memory leak is where an application fails to return allocated memory back to the system, causing it to crash. An attacker can cause a null pointer dereference, making an application point to nothing in memory and causing it to crash. An integer overflow is where a large number is placed in a smaller section of memory, causing extra space to overflow into other areas, which an attacker can manipulate. A directory traversal attack allows an attacker to access parts of a server's file system that they should not be able to. Error messages can reveal too much information about the underlying system, which an attacker can use to exploit the system. Input into an application must be evaluated to prevent malicious input that can cause denial of service or access to sensitive information. An API attack involves manipulating the application programming interface to gain additional access.
